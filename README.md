# Sublime Maybs Quit

Why are <kbd>ctrl/cmd</kbd> + <kbd>w</kbd> (close file) and <kbd>ctrl/cmd</kbd> + <kbd>q</kbd> (quit) right next to each other?!?! I'm just trying to close a file, but for some insane reason my pinky drifts 1cm to the left and my whole SublimeText instance disappears. Never again!

## Usage

Quitting shouldn't be so easy. Modal confirmation dialogs are annoying, so why not show a quick panel instead?

- <kbd>ctrl/cmd</kbd> + <kbd>q</kbd>: opens up a quick panel (shown below) that let you choose from a number of options

### Why not just change your shortcuts

Muscle memory... why fight it?
